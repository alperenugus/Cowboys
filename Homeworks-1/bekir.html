      <h1>About Myself</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <span class="name">Bekir Duran Karalar</span>.I am working as
        a QA Engineer in Dallas/Texas. I work in hybrid model and Bekir is
        supposed to go to office twice a week but I usually like to go to office
        4 or 5 times a week. Because my home is only 8 minutes away from my
        office by walking. And, I lke to work in office because while working at
        home I believe that I am not too much productive. And in our office we
        have good coffee machines which serves one of the best coffee in the
        world. And I also like to play ping pong with my coworkers. I am not
        that good at it but it is really good break from work.<br /><br />On the
        other side we are playing pickkleball with our friends but they are not
        good as much as I am. But
        <span class="name">Bekir Duran Karalar</span> is helping them to get
        better because if you do not play with a person who is better than you.
        You can not improve yoursef. For that reason I am sacrificing my time
        and helping them to get better and I hope they will be good one day like
        me. Then we also like to play soccer with our friends every week. But I
        realized I am much more better than my friends that is why they start
        booking the soccer fields on the days that I am not free. But I feel
        them that is why I let them play with their own level friends. Because
        If you are better than your friends at sports. It is not fun anymore.
        You start just being volenteer to play with good player.
        <span class="name">Bekir Duran Karalar</span> also forget to mention
        about our fifa nights with our friends. My friends are at the begginer
        level. But it is still fun to play fifa with them. Because when they
        score against me. They are getting happy as small kidos. And it makes
        <span class="name">Bekir Duran Karalar</span> feel happy too :)
